# UniversityHelper

This is my University Helper App created for a uni assignment in 2017

The app stores information about a student's uni studies locally on their device such as:
 * grades
 * classes
 * assignments
 * notes - including voice to text
 * to do lists
 
 It also calculates GPA and has a custom SOS button in case the student needs help which can be set to any number and can be defaulted to emergency services.
 
 This is a work in progress and I'm intending on adding OCR for scanning notes in and possibly achievements as well, though these are currently disabled.
